**Why Split Screen?**
This isn't just for show - during the competition, players will be running two games side by side, each taking up exactly this much space. This view helps you develop with that in mind!

**Key Things to Know**
- Your game will be pre-launched before players connect - save any fancy stuff for when they actually start playing
- Players will have different screen sizes, so that amazing ASCII art might not look the same for everyone
- Aim for a quick but clear introduction - help players understand how to play without overwhelming them

**Pro Tips**
- If your game works well in this split view, you're golden
- Try the full-screen button to test different sizes
- Keep it simple and robust!

**File limitations**
- 128KB per file
- Up to 64 files per game
- Filenames can only contain English letters, numbers, ".", "-", "_", and " ".

**Using Display Libraries?**
If you're using curses or similar tools:
- Screen size starts at 80x24, updates on connect
- Expect some size changes in the first second
- Test your display at different sizes

Remember: A game that runs smoothly is way better than one that's flashy but temperamental. Have fun creating! ðŸŽ®`) +
